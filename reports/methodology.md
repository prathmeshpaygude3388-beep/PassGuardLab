## Methodology

The platform uses analytical modeling instead of live exploitation.
Passwords are processed only in memory and immediately destroyed after analysis.

### Feature Extraction
- Password length
- Character diversity
- Entropy estimation
- Structural patterns

### Attack Simulation
Each attack is simulated probabilistically:
- Brute force feasibility
- Dictionary likelihood
- Mutation predictability
- Credential reuse modeling
- Password spraying patterns
- Social engineering susceptibility
- MFA fatigue analysis

### AI-Based Analysis
Risk-weighted probabilistic models are used to:
- Rank attack feasibility
- Predict fastest compromise path
- Forecast next security failure

### Analytics
- Kill chain mapping
- Blast radius calculation
- Security maturity assessment
- Risk trend analysis

No real password cracking or unauthorized access is performed at any stage.

## Security, Ethics, and Legal Considerations

PASSGUARD LABS is designed as a defensive security research platform.

### Ethical Controls
- No real-world attacks
- No password storage
- No credential logging
- No breached datasets

### Legal Compliance
- Synthetic datasets only
- Privacy-by-design architecture
- Zero-knowledge password handling

### Academic Integrity
The platform avoids demonstrating hacking techniques and instead focuses on
risk assessment, mitigation, and compliance alignment.

All experiments are conducted in a controlled environment for educational
purposes only.

## Abstract

Passwords continue to be a dominant authentication mechanism despite being
one of the weakest security controls in modern systems. Most academic projects
focus on password cracking demonstrations, which neither reflect real-world
attack strategies nor address defensive security requirements.

This project presents PASSGUARD LABS, an AI-driven identity security platform
that analytically simulates multiple password attack vectors and evaluates
password resistance without performing real-world exploitation. The platform
combines attack simulation, resistance scoring, risk analytics, AI-based attack
prioritization, defense recommendation, and compliance mapping.

PASSGUARD LABS follows a zero-knowledge design approach where passwords are
never stored or logged. The system aligns with modern security principles such
as Zero Trust Architecture, NIST SP 800-63, and ISO/IEC 27001. The platform is
intended for defensive cybersecurity research, education, and pre-breach
identity risk assessment.

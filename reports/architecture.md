## System Architecture

PASSGUARD LABS follows a modular, platform-based architecture designed
to separate execution logic, analytics, security enforcement, and governance.

### High-Level Flow

User Input
→ Feature Extraction
→ Attack Simulation Engine
→ AI Risk & Prediction Layer
→ Analytics & Impact Modeling
→ Defense Recommendation Engine
→ Compliance Mapping
→ Security Dashboard

### Architectural Layers

- UI Layer (Streamlit-based SOC-style interface)
- Core Engine (feature extraction, resistance scoring)
- Attack Models (analytical attack simulations)
- AI Models (attack prioritization and failure prediction)
- Analytics Layer (kill chain, blast radius, trends)
- Security Layer (zero-knowledge, zero trust, hashing analysis)
- Compliance Layer (NIST, ISO 27001, Zero Trust mapping)

This separation ensures scalability, maintainability, and ethical compliance.

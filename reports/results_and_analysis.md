## Results and Analysis

The platform produces multi-dimensional outputs rather than a binary
strong/weak classification.

### Sample Outputs
- Password Resistance Score (0–100)
- Ranked attack vectors by risk
- Overall identity risk score
- Kill chain progression
- Security maturity level
- Compliance gap identification

### Observations
- Dictionary-based and spraying attacks show the highest probability
  against weak human-generated passwords.
- MFA significantly reduces blast radius but introduces fatigue risk.
- Strong hashing algorithms reduce offline attack feasibility but do not
  mitigate credential reuse risks.

The results demonstrate that password security must be evaluated as a system
problem rather than an isolated control.

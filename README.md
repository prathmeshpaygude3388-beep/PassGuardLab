# PASSGUARD LABS

PASSGUARD LABS is an identity security research platform that analytically
simulates password attack strategies and generates defensive recommendations.

Unlike traditional password-checking tools, PASSGUARD LABS focuses on
**risk modeling, resistance scoring, and defense optimization** rather than
real-world exploitation.

## Key Capabilities

- Password Resistance Scoring (Resistance Score™)
- Analytical simulation of common attack strategies
- Attack risk estimation (brute force, dictionary, mutation)
- Automated defense recommendations
- Zero-knowledge password handling
- Security-focused, ethical design

---

## Platform Philosophy

PASSGUARD LABS does **not** perform live attacks, cracking, or unauthorized
access. All evaluations are based on probabilistic and analytical models.

The platform is designed for:
- Cybersecurity research
- Defensive security education
- Identity risk assessment
- Pre-breach security analysis

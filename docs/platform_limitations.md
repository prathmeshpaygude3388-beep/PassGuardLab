# Platform Limitations

PASSGUARD LABS is a research and assessment platform, not a live security tool.

## Known Limitations
- No real-time authentication telemetry
- No integration with live IAM systems
- No actual password cracking
- Analytical models rely on assumptions

## Rationale
These limitations are intentional to:
- maintain ethical boundaries
- avoid legal risks
- focus on defensive security education

Future versions may integrate external data sources in controlled environments.

# Attack Taxonomy

PASSGUARD LABS categorizes password attacks into analytical classes
based on real-world attacker behavior.

## Attack Categories
- Brute Force (computational feasibility)
- Dictionary Attacks (common word usage)
- Mutation Attacks (predictable substitutions)
- Credential Stuffing (password reuse)
- Password Spraying (common password distribution)
- Markov Pattern Attacks (human behavior modeling)
- Offline Hash Attacks (post-breach scenarios)
- Social Engineering Attacks (human factors)
- MFA Fatigue Attacks (authentication abuse)

Each attack is simulated probabilistically and never executed on live systems.

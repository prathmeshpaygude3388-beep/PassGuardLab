# AI Decision Logic

The AI layer in PASSGUARD LABS is designed for explainability rather
than opaque machine learning.

## Key Functions
- Attack prioritization
- Probability-based ranking
- Failure forecasting

## Design Choices
- Risk-weighted scoring
- Confidence-aware predictions
- Deterministic logic with extensibility

The AI does not replace security judgment but augments it by
highlighting the most likely attack paths.

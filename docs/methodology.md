# Methodology

PASSGUARD LABS follows a defensive, analytical methodology rather than
demonstrating live exploitation or password cracking.

## Core Principles
- Zero-knowledge password handling
- No real credential storage
- Analytical risk modeling
- Explainable decision-making

## Execution Flow
1. Password input is processed in memory
2. Security features are extracted
3. Multiple attack vectors are simulated analytically
4. Risks are aggregated and ranked
5. AI models prioritize threats
6. Analytics compute impact and maturity
7. Defensive controls are recommended
8. Compliance alignment is evaluated

This methodology ensures ethical compliance and real-world relevance.

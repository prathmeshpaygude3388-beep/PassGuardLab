# Security Design

Security is enforced at every layer of PASSGUARD LABS.

## Key Controls
- Zero-knowledge password processing
- No persistent storage of credentials
- No real attack execution
- Privacy-by-design enforcement
- Zero Trust identity modeling

## Threat Model
PASSGUARD LABS assumes:
- Attackers target credentials
- Humans reuse passwords
- MFA reduces but does not eliminate risk

The platform is intentionally defensive and research-oriented.

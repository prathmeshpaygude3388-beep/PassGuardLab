# Password Resistance Score™

The Password Resistance Score™ is a proprietary metric designed
to quantify password resilience across multiple attack vectors.

## Score Range
- 0–39   : Weak
- 40–69  : Moderate
- 70–89  : Strong
- 90–100 : Highly Resistant

## Inputs
- Entropy estimation
- Brute force feasibility
- Dictionary susceptibility
- Mutation predictability

## Design Goals
- Explainable scoring
- Tunable weights
- Defense-oriented interpretation

The score is not a replacement for security controls but an indicator
of relative password risk.
